# PyClimat

This repository contains scripts for Python Module for Climate data analysis and Visualization, which is under development. The module performs many climate data analysis like correlation, significance testing, causality testing, estimation of climatologies, etc. The current version of package can be used, however, it must be handle with caution since most of the functions are yet to be tested on higher level. Kindly contact me for help if required.  

## Installation

Information about the installation of the package would be updated shortly. However, the PyClimat.yml contains all the dependencies that can be install to use the module. 

## Examples

The examples folder contains some sample scripts for using the module. The data used in these scripts are module outputs from ECHAM5-wiso (Atmospheric Global Circulation Model with isotope tracking capabilities) and ERA-Interim Reanalysis. Due to the size of these dataset, I can't upload them but it can be provided on request.
